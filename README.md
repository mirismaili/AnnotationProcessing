# AnnotationProcessing
This repository (Android Studio project) is an implementation of 
[@Mert-Şimşek's tutorial on medium.com about annotation processing in Java (and Android)](https://medium.com/@iammert/annotation-processing-dont-repeat-yourself-generate-your-code-8425e60c6657)
that is created with a more recent version of Android Studio (v3.2), Gradle (v4.6), plug-ins and libraries 
(almost most recent at the time the repository created/updated: Oct 18, 2018). Thank he.
